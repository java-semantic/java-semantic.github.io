# Conventional Commits

## What are Conventional Commits?

Conventional Commits are a convention for commit messages that explicitly describe the nature of the commit change. This explicit description enables automated parsing of commit messages as well as a simple human readable summery of the commit. 

## Structure of Conventional Commits.

Conventional Commits are structured as follows  

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```
The 'type' field must comply with the convention decided on in order to allow the commits to be automatically parsed. 

## Types 
The following table details the possible 'type' values and what they represent in the context of semantic software versioning.
